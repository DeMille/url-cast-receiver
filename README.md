# URL Cast Receiver

**Custom chromecast receiver to display webpages without tab casting**

Try it with the [sender demo](https://demille.github.io/url-cast-receiver).

## Usage

You can use a hosted version now (use **5CB45E5A** for your appId),
or you can clone / customize this repo and host your own.

URLs are sent to the receiver by sending messages on the `urn:x-cast:com.url.cast` namespace.

There are two ways to cast a URL to the reciever, each with pros and cons:

**Method 1:** Loading the URL in an iframe
- Pros: Reciever stays intact after loading page
- Cons: `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` errors

```js
// iframe method
var namespace = 'urn:x-cast:com.url.cast';
var msg = {
    "type": "iframe",
    "url": "http://example.com"
}

session.sendMessage(namespace, msg, onSuccess, onErr);
// reciever is still alive
```

**Method 2:** Changing the window location on the chromecast
- Pros: Can load any URL, no iframe origin issues
- Cons: Reciever gets overridden with page load, so you can no longer communicate with it without stopping the cast and restarting.

```js
// window.location method
var namespace = 'urn:x-cast:com.url.cast';
var msg = {
    "type": "loc",
    "url": "http://example.com"
}

session.sendMessage(namespace, msg, onSuccess, onErr);
// receiver is now basically dead to you
```

## Notes

- The chromecast renders webpages at a viewport size of 1280x720 instead of 1080x1920 like you might expect, so be prepared for that.

- The default background color on the chromecast is black, so pages loaded with method 2 (the window location) might have a surprise black background.  If you use the iframe method, the receiver sets the body to white.
